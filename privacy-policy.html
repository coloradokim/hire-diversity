          <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
          <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
            with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p>




          <h3>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h3>
          <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
          <p> Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page
            specified above.</p>
          <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: On our Privacy Policy Page</p>
          <p>Can change your personal information: By emailing us.</p>


          <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>

          <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

          <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>
          <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

          <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
          <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
            agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

          <h3>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</h3>
          <p>No.</p>

          <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
          <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
            Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

          <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
          <p>We will notify you via email</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
            individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

          <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>
          <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
          <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
            <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
            <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
            <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
            <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
            <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
            <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
          </ul>

          <p> If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at support@hirediversity.us and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
